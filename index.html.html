            <h3>Internship Project</h3>
            <p>I've completed my intern project report in Sri Ganapathy Jewellers which is located in Ganapathy, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. My intern report is about working in the Stock Taking Department, Maintenance Department and Designing Department. I've gained a lot of experience in this intern project report and also came to knew much about the Jewel industry.
                I've come to know that there are various procedures in the Maintenance Department like entering the details both Manual and Automatically in the maintenance notes as well as in the computer</p>
            <h4>Stock Taking Department</h4>
            <p>Stocks are taken by the staff members of the company every day and are uploaded in the data base. Stocks are taken to avoid any theft or stolen. If some thing is missing they can easily find out what type of product it is and to whom that product is shown. So if the product is stolen by any person it can be verified and find out the theft by viewing them in CCTV SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. and the footage is sent to the police and further action is taken by them. It also shows what are the product needed and what are the products not needed.</p>
            <h4>Maintenance Department</h4>
            <p>Display products at the counter
                <p>Clean thy counter
                   Display trays one by one instead of all together
                   Clean the jewellery off any strains or dust
                Display products attractively.</p>
